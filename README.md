# Challenge: RPG

## ☀️ About The Project

I did the RPG once with the [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) tutorial and I'm starting again from scratch to improve my skills in JavaScript. 

I want to add some Characters (heroes and monsters) and some items to the game. Also, I want to add some quests to the game and a random generator for the monsters.
